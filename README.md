# Presidents Cup CTF Challenges (Self-Hosted Versions)

Welcome to a collection of custom CTF-style challenges originally created for the **Presidents Cup** cybersecurity competition. These challenges have been adapted for self-hosting so you can run them locally, use them for training, or just have fun breaking things in a safe environment.


Some of these were not open sourced, so I recreated them.  Changed versions will be included in a subfolder of the main challenge.


## üß† What's Inside

This repo includes several challenges I authored for Presidents Cup. Each one has been updated (or will be) to support self-hosted deployment, typically via Docker, VMs, or standalone files.

Expect a mix of:
- **Digital forensics puzzles**
- **Binary exploitation**
- **Reverse engineering**
- **Web exploits**
- **Custom file recovery tasks**
- ...and a few oddballs thrown in for flavor

## üöß Status

This is a work in progress as I convert each challenge for public release. Some may be ready to go out of the box, others might need minor setup.

Check each challenge folder for:
- Deployment instructions
- Flag format (usually or will be updated to `flag{}` style)
- Any required tools or dependencies
- in the main folder is wordlist.txt, which I've used to seed any of the pc# challenges, any subsequent ones I make may not use this if the intention is to show the masking features of hybrid cracking for instance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Docker (for most challenge containers)
- Kali Linux or similar (for analysis tools)
- A sense of curiosity and a thirst for justice

## üìÅ Structure

Each challenge with solution guide is in its own folder.
